# # Notes:
# ## overrides
# Following the official sqlc documentation to we need to specify override options
# for nullable and non-nullable uuid types separately.
# Excerpt from https://docs.sqlc.dev/en/stable/howto/overrides.html
# >> A single db_type override configuration applies to either nullable or non-nullable columns, but not both.
# >> If you want the same Go type to override regardless of nullability, you’ll need to configure two overrides:
# >> one with nullable: true and one without.
